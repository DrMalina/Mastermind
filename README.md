# Mastermind JS Edition
A take on a classical code breaking game.

Throughout the project I tried to focus more on a JS logic behind the game, not the performance, UI or  a 'clean' CSS. Having said that, basic principles of RWD are implemented.

Additionaly, for this project, I stood away from any design patterns and also private methods - let's say that the global scope might be a little dirty, but to be honest my goal was to get this project running and working properly, all while having easy-to-understand clean code.

Any feedback appreciated:)
