# Mastermind JS Edition
My take on a classical code breaking game from childhood.

Throughout the project I tried to focus more on a JS logic behind the game. Having said that, basic principles of RWD are implemented.

My goal was to get this project running and working properly, all while trying to have easy to understand code.

Any feedback appreciated:)
